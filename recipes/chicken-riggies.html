<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This results in a sauce that seems much richer than it actually is, and I think you'll love the subtle sweetness the wine imparts, which works wonderfully with the heat from the peppers.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>4 ounces hot Italian ground sausage meat</li>
    <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
    <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, roughly chopp</li>
    <li>½ cup Marsala wine</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can whole Italian plum tomatoes (such as San Marzano), crushed</li>
    <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir sausage, mushrooms, onions, salt, and black pepper in hot oil until vegetables are softened and sausage is browned, 6 to 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir chopped chicken to sausage mixture; cook and stir over medium-high heat until browned, about 5 minutes. Pour in wine and cook, stirring to remove any browned bits off the bottom of the pan, until most of the wine is evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, chicken broth, and cream; simmer for 30 minutes. If needed, add water to create a thick sauce.</li>
    <li>Stir peppers, olives, and garlic into sauce. Continue to simmer until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and stir in parsley.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until nearly cooked, about 11 minutes. Drain.</li>
    <li>Combine sauce and cooked pasta, stir in cheese, cover and set aside until pasta has absorbed the sauce, 1 to 2 minute</li>
